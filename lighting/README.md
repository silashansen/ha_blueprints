# Lighting Blueprints

This directory contains blueprints for lighting automations.

## Blueprints

### Motion Light with Time (`motion_light_time.yaml`)
A blueprint for controlling lights based on motion detection with time-based conditions. This blueprint provides basic motion-activated lighting without humidity considerations.

### Motion Light with Time and Humidity (`motion_light_time_humid.yaml`)
An enhanced version of the motion light blueprint that includes humidity-based conditions. This is particularly useful for bathroom lighting where humidity levels can indicate occupancy.
