## List of blueprints

| Blueprint | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| [ENOcean light switch + brightess](/enocean_switch.yaml) | Control two different lights with a 4 button Enocean switch (+/- brightness per light) |
| [ENOcean light switch + brightness and color](/enocean_switch_color.yaml) | Control a 4 button Enocean switch with two buttons controlling light intensity and two buttons cycling between colors |
| [Motion detector light action](/motion_light_time.yaml) | Simple motion detection that will turn on a light, but also cancel the automation if the light is turned off, ex. by a manual switch. |
| [Sonos control with Philips Tap Dial](/philips_tap_dial_sonos.yaml) | Use Philips Tap Dial to control the volume, play, pause, next, previous of an entire Sonos Group. This handles the volume across the entire group, which is not trivial |
